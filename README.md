# Whiskey Tasting

This is a web application for organizing whiskey tasting events. It allows administrators to set up themes and whiskeys for tastings, participants to submit ratings on aroma, flavor, and finish, and everyone to view results and rankings.

The application is designed to be simple and accessible, including for elderly users who may not be comfortable with technology. For this reason, it has minimal authentication—participants enter only their names to join a tasting, with no passwords, accounts, or complex login processes.

I developed this project on NixOS to learn more about the operating system and its capabilities for software development.

## Setup

See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for instructions on how to get the application running locally or with Docker.
